* i3wm Config Mode

An expansion of ~conf-mode~ to bring proper syntax highlighting to your i3wm config.

** Features

This package builds on ~conf-space-mode~ (which is the major mode emacs assigns to i3wm's config file by default) and
expands its font-lock capabilities to provide proper syntax highlighting for the small language i3wm's config uses.

The new syntax highlighting faces do not define their own colours, but instead derive from Emacs' own font-locking
faces, making sure that they fit in with any theme.

Features and settings outside font-locking are not touched and will be inherited from ~conf-space-mode~.

** How to use
This mode will activate for files whose path ends with ~...i3/config~. If you use a different name, you can activate
this mode via a file-local variable by placing the line ~# -*- mode: i3wm-config -*-~ at the top of your i3wm config
file (as seen in the first screenshot).

** Known limitations
The regular expressions used here have not been tested on config files other than my own making it unlikely they will
cover all edge cases and keywords. If you find anything amiss open up an issue and I'll have it fixed.

Colour codes like ~#6699CC~ are intentionally untouched. [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/rainbow-mode.html][rainbow-mode]] should be used to handle colour highlighting.
